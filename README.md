Features in the Timetable generator:

            The generator will be a progressive web application, which makes it available on mobile devices and desktops. 
            The introductory interface consist of a login for students that are currently registered to the school.
            A registered user has access to time slots and venues in which his/her lectures are held.
            Lectures users have features to help them to make announcements,get updated about the venues and to post necessary documents for students.
